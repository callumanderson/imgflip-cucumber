#Technical exercise, automated testing

## What to test

Please test the meme creation functionality on "https://imgflip.com/".

Visit their homepage and from there proceed to the meme creation tool.  
Select a specific meme as the template image (do not use the default), add top and bottom sentences, and create the meme.

In the lightbox, verify that the "Image HTML" value contains syntactically valid HTML.

Proceed to "go to image page", and verify that the title matches the meme template.  
Also verify that the image description on the right contains the custom phrases used to create the meme.
